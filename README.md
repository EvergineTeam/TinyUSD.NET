# TinyUSD.NET

This repository contains a thin low-level autogenerated C# binding for tinyusdz used by Evergine.
tinyusdz is a lightweight, single-header C++ library for handling USD (Universal Scene Description) files

## How it works

This automated binding is generated based on the **tinyusdz** C++ project. For more details, see the original project:

- [tinyusdz GitHub repository](https://github.com/lighttransport/tinyusdz)

The binding allows developers to interact with USD files in C# using the **tinyusdz** functionality, including:

- USD file parsing
- Scene graph manipulation
- Exporting and importing assets

## Test

Check at `Generator\Test` an Evergine project created with the default template which uses the bindings.
